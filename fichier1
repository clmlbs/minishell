Penguins (order Sphenisciformes, family Spheniscidae) are a group of 
aquatic flightless birds. They live almost exclusively in the Southern 
Hemisphere: only one species, the Galapagos penguin, is found north 
of the Equator. Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have 
countershaded dark and white plumage and flippers for swimming.
